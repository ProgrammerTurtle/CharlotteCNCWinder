Charlotte, named after Charlotte's Web, is a CNC filament winder intended for winding composite tubing. Carbon fiber, fiberglass, and even basalt composite are among the capabilities of this fully custom designed machine. My intention for this machine is to wind my own composite rocket body tubes and motor casings for high performance amateur rocketry. 

## Features

- Full 2040 aluminum extrusion frame
- 60 inches of usable tube length
- Max tube diameter of 8.5 inches
- Nema 23 mandrel and linear motors with a Nema 17 motor for delivery head rotation
- Servobelt linear drive, which is a novel approach to belted motion systems, effectively turning a belt into a rack and pinion
- Marlin firmware 
- Fully open source
- [Cyclone](https://github.com/reilleya/cyclone) control software support (made by Andrew Reilley)

This project is inspired by Andrew Reilley's filament winder design, [Contraption](https://www.reilley.net/winder/). Every part in my design is unique from the design of Contraption. 

The Bill of Materials for this project may be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RtFfvJP7feuvO1JXcSI9StIg2ivD9I2__bdsefE5s5Q/edit?usp=sharing and is also attached to this repository as a .csv in the DesignFiles folder.
